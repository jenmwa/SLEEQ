To be honest, I didn’t know whether or not to upload this.<br>
Because, this is a mess.

As a startup company we needed a website, and I really wanted to learn to do it.

It’s based on a free template from shapingrain,
https://shapingrain.com/free-landing-page-template/ 

And I created the website step by step and with a lot of googling och try to figure out how’s everything is connected, and to make it work.
Didn’t have much experience doing a complete business webpage that would go public, but you live and you learn.

There’s a lot I would do differently now, like structure, planning, an oversight, more efficient and to NOT have so much copy/paste code, but I’m here to learn, and we have all started somewhere.

i like to se myself grow as a creator and as a person, and this project actually was the project that actually got me to take the step of learning more and to become a Front End Developer.
Forever greatful for the opportunity, in spite of all the sleepless nights and them grey hairs. ;)
